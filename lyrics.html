    <h3>Never Gonna Give You Up Lyrics (Snippet)</h3>
    <pre>
     We're no strangers to love
     You know the rules and so do I

     A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
     You wouldn't get this from any other guy
     I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
     Gotta make you understand
     Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
     We've known each other for so long
     Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
     Inside, we both know what's been going on
     We know the game, and we're gonna play it
     And if you ask me how I'm feeling
     Don't tell me you're too blind to see
     Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
     Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
     Ooh (Give you up)
     Ooh-ooh (Give you up)
     Ooh (Never gonna give, never gonna give)
     Give you up
     Ooh-ooh (Never gonna give, never gonna give)
     Give you up
     We've known each other for so long
     Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
     Inside, we both know what's been going on
     We know the game, and we're gonna play it
     I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
     Gotta make you understand
     Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
     Never gonna give you up

     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
     Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
     Never gonna give you up
     Never gonna let you down
     Never gonna run around and desert you
     Never gonna make you cry
     Never gonna say goodbye
     Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
